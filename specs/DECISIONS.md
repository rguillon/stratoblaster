# Decisions log

> Agent appends an entry for every non-trivial technical choice not dictated by the specs
> (library choice, architecture pattern, deviation from a SHOULD, etc.).
> Human may veto by changing the status to `Rejected` and explaining why.
>
> D-001 to D-233 are in [`../specs_old/DECISIONS.md`](../specs_old/DECISIONS.md). Each of them is now
> held by a requirement, or marked superseded or obsolete: see
> [`TRACEABILITY.md`](TRACEABILITY.md) §2. Numbering continues from D-234. A decision that changes
> what the game does or how it is built is also written into the requirement it concerns (a new one,
> or an existing one updated), so the specs stay the single source of truth.

### D-234 — Specs organised by function, with new requirement IDs traced in the code
- **Date:** 2026-11-01
- **Requirements:** every file under `specs/` (see [README](README.md)).
- **Context:** owner request: the phase files had become a history of changes, with later phases,
  review feedback and 233 decisions amending earlier requirements. Finding what an enemy, a boss or
  a level must look like and do meant reading several phases and the log.
- **Decision:**
  - The old `specs/` moved, unchanged, to `specs_old/`. The new specs have one file per feature,
    enemy kind, boss and level, in `gameplay/`, `ui/`, `audio/`, `graphics/`, `enemies/`,
    `bosses/` (`common.md`, `mini/`, `final/`), `worlds/world-N/` (`world.md` and one file per
    level) and `dev/`, plus `01-engineering.md` and `performance.md`.
  - Requirement IDs are `<file prefix>-NN` (`ENM-GNAT-04`, `LVL-2-3-05`, `BOSS-12`). `ENG` keeps its
    numbers. The old `GD-xx` and `Pxx-Ryy` IDs are retired; `TRACEABILITY.md` maps each one, and each
    old decision, to the new IDs.
  - The requirements describe the game as it is today: the old text, every later amendment (review
    feedback, decisions), and the current code for numbers. Where the code and the latest request
    disagree with nothing to explain it, the requirement keeps the request and says
    `**Discrepancy:**`; where nothing implements it, it says so.
  - Implementation choices in the old decisions became general requirements (mostly `ENG`,
    `PERF`), not one requirement per decision (owner's choice).
  - The code and tests were re-tagged to the new IDs (owner's choice): comments, docstrings and test
    names name the new IDs; decision references (`D-xxx`) stay as history.
- **Alternatives considered:** keeping the old IDs in the code with a mapping table only (smaller
  change, but two ID schemes to read side by side); one requirement per decision (owner: no).
- **Consequences:** `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/commands/`, `specs_old/phases/_TEMPLATE.md` and
  `specs_old/PROGRESS.md` still describe the phase-by-phase workflow; adapting them is left to the
  owner (owner's choice: specs only).
- **Status:** Accepted
